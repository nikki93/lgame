----------

- an abstract 'system dependencies' mechanism
  - you can establish relationships of the form 'system x depends on
    y in z,' for example system gui depends on text in initialization,
    or system sprite depends on transform in entity ownership
  - you can make queries of the form "get ordered list of systems in
    z," for example, "get systems in initialization order"
  - you can ask what a system depends on in z, for example while adding
    an entity to an entity system

- don't use initialize-instance for logic side-effects stuff
  - might want to do memory pool stuff later
  - if you fix the above make sure to forward cell initargs and change
    the name of the deinit counterpart

- add a next-frame macro to run stuff at the end of the frame

- add entity cell caching -- each cell keeps track of frequently-queried
  'next' cells
