An attempt at reducing creative friction between the artist and the
artwork.


Running
-------

Put this somewhere quicklisp can find it. Then,

    (ql:quickload :lgame)

Alternatively, load it using ASDF or just manually from a REPL.

After that, get in the package,

    (in-package :lgame)

Now you're ready to roll! Just run,

    (run-game)

Check the bottom of test.lisp to see how the oscillator and rotator
systems are defined. You can interact with the game in real-time using
the REPL. For example, `(run-game)` then `(test-basic)`. Then `(setf
(rate (=oscillator= player)) 3)` while the game is running.
